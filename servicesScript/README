This folder contains some service files as well as a aria2c's config file.
These files would be useful for users hoping to setup a bot service on a 
Linux server and even setup a aria2c rpc service to deal with magnet links.
However, exploiting these files requires user has some basic Linux and 
systemd knowledge. User should view every file to modify its settings. For 
more information, please Google.
